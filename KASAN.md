## Overview

*Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN)* is a fast memory corruption detector for the Linux kernel.
KASAN detects out-of-bounds, use-after-free, and invalid-free bugs in slab, page_alloc, vmalloc, stack, and global memory.

KASAN has 3 modes:

* [Generic KASAN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html#generic-kasan), which is intended to be used for debugging.
This mode is supported by many CPU architectures.

* [Software Tag-Based KASAN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html#software-tag-based-kasan), which is intended for testing in near-production environments.
This mode has a lower RAM overhead than the Generic mode but is only supported on arm64.

* [Hardware Tag-Based KASAN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html#hardware-tag-based-kasan), which intended to be used in production as an in-field bug detector or a security mitigation.
This mode is based on the Arm Memory Tagging Extension and is expected to have a very low performance overhead.

For more details about each mode, see the [kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html) and these talks:
